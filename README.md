### Problem we are trying to solve:
- Remote learning and online exams have increased due to COVID-19.
- Proctoring challenges lead to cheating and unfair practices.

### Problems with the existing system:
- Requires two separate platforms: one for exams (e.g., Google Forms) and one for video proctoring (e.g., Meet, Zoom).
- Manual proctoring is needed, which is inefficient.
- Our solution aims to develop an application for automatic proctoring, eliminating the need for manual monitoring by teachers.
